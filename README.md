For this challenge, I was given the task of creating a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that scores the user's high scores so they can gauge their progress compared to their peers.

## Acceptance Criteria

THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
